## How do I join the team?
Follow our instagram for hiring updates! We typically hire at the beginning of each competition season, mid-end of September.

## Do you accept students from any year level?
Yes! Some of our most valued members have been on the team since their first year. As long as you are an undergraduate student eager to learn and work well in a team context for a common goal, come join us!

## What background do I need to have to join iGEM?
As an interdisciplinary team, we welcome students from all backgrounds! Our team currently consists of members from over 12 disciplines, contributing to different aspects of our work ranging from administration to building hardware.

## Do I need to have any particular experience to be considered?
Not necessarily. We look for students with willingness to learn and genuine enthusiasm! Since synthetic biology is a niche subject, we do not expect extensive knowledge of the field. BUT we do require you to complement this with an eagerness to learn the necessary concepts and skills.
