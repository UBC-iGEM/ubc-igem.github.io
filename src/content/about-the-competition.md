## About the competition

The International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) competition is an annual worldwide synthetic biology, where student teams design, build, and test innovative biological systems. Teams use standardized, interchangeable biological parts and molecular biology techniques to tackle real-world problems. This work brings together students from biology, engineering, computer science, and other fields. Since 2003, iGEM has expanded to include high school, undergraduate, and graduate students, along with community labs and entrepreneursâ€”now engaging thousands worldwide.

Teams work for months on their projects before presenting at the Grand Jamboree to a global audience and expert judges. Projects earn awards based on innovation, execution, and impact. Beyond competition, iGEM champions the responsible advancement of synthetic biology, fostering an open and collaborative scientific community.
