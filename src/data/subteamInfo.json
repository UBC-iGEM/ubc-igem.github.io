    "description": "The Wet Lab subteam leads the hands-on experimental work to create synthetic biological systems. After ideation, we review literature, design plasmids in silico, perform molecular biology experiments, and characterize the function of our genetically engineered machines. We work closely with the Dry Lab subteam to test hardware integration and use computational biology to improve our synthetic constructs. Together, we run experiments to prove our system works as intended in our target application, ensuring every step from design to validation is scientifically rigorous.",
