## We are UBC iGEM.

As a team of undergraduate students representing UBC, we promote interdisciplinary thinking in synthetic biology. Our team creates a platform for students at all educational levels to explore their passion for synthetic biology through competition research, educational outreach, and science communication.

Our award-winning team achieved a Gold Medal and won two special prizes (Best Hardware and Best Sustainable Development Impact) at the 2024 iGEM Grand Jamboree held in Paris, France. Additionally, we placed in the Top 5 for the iGEM Village competition in Biomanufacturing, cementing our status as the best-performing undergraduate team in North America.
