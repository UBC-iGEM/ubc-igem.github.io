For each past project, we may addpot a component-based structure
At first glance, we can see that this component will contain the following paramters:
    1. A title 
    2. A description
    3. A link to this project
    4. An icon
    5. A list of awards earned for that project
    6. Year/ description

Notes: 
1. specifically for the list of awards, each award can be a separate component, that is composed of 
    an icon plus a description

Dev notes,
    1. the dot on the timeline should come with the each component, as well as the year corresponding to that component
    2. For each component, I will leave 0 space between the timeline and that project block, so if I add a dot to the
        onto the left border of that project block, it will overlap with the timeline perfectly.
